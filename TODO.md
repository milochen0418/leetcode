# next-permutation
I only refer https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/solution/ to write C++
and I still have no idea how to think this problem.
# remove-duplicate-letters 
Use Monotonic to solve but I just rewrite Java answer into C++ answer. 
I don't know deatil of why it can be. Need to study more.
# rotate-list
The current solution is not mine.

# champagne-tower
Not yet finish

# duplicate-zeros

## minimum-difference-in-sums-after-removal-of-elements
還沒解出來，不曉得為什麼算法會不對，還要研究

## subarray-sum-equals-k
dirty work to solve testcase ,-1,1,-1,1,-1,1,-1 but not truely to solve

## best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv (Hard)
目前還沒有想到怎麼解決 k=c 的問題， k=1 k=無限大都有手中解了 
Len Chen的討論串有指引，但我想用自己的方法
